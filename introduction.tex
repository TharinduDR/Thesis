%Having a good STS metric is crucial for many natural language processing applications such as information retrieval (IR) \cite{Majumder2016SemanticTS}, text summarisation \cite{Aliguliyev2009ANS,10.1177/0165551511408848}, question answering \cite{mohler-etal-2011-learning} and text classification \cite{rocchio71relevance}. Semantic similarity also contributes to many semantic web applications like community extraction, ontology generation and entity disambiguation \cite{Li2006SentenceSB}, and it is also useful for Twitter search \cite{10.1016/S0306-4573(96)00062-3}, where it is required to accurately measure semantic relatedness between concepts or entities \cite{xu-etal-2015-semeval}. STS is not limited only to natural language processing. For example in Biomedical Informatics, it can be used to compare genes \cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000937}.
